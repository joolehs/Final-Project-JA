                <p>Gol · D · Roger was the only person in history to have conquered the &ldquo;Grand Line&rdquo; and amassed a vast fortune, the legendary treasure ONE PIECE.
                This earned him the title &ldquo;King of the Pirates&rdquo;.
                Wealth, Fame, Power. He obtained this and everything else the world had to offer, and his dying words drove countless souls to the seas.<br><br>
                <strong>&ldquo;My treasure? I want you all to find it! I left everything in one place.&rdquo;</strong><br><br>
                These words lured men to the Grand Line, in pursuit of dreams greater than they've ever dared to imagine!
                The pirates fight under the banner of belief and raise their names, looking for ambition, while some seek passion, over the One Piece left by the Pirate King.
                In such a time full of adventure, one boy aimed for &ldquo;King of the Pirates&rdquo; and set sail for the Grand Line!</p>

                  body the properties of rubber. His lifelong dream is to become
                  the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Pirate King,
                  Gol D. Roger. He believes that being Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.<br><br>

                the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates. Chopper is a reindeer that ate the Hito Hito no Mi which is a devil fruit
                that allows its user to transform into a human hybrid or a human at will. He came from Drum Island where he learned
                how to be a doctor, which also makes him the only member of the Straw Hats who was born on the Grand Line. He is also
                the youngest member on board. Chopper's dream is to become a great doctor that can cure any disease.<br><br>

            He initially burst on the scene as an enemy during the Water 7 arc, but his cool attitude and awesome array of gadgetry quickly wins over the Straw Hats.
            He's one heck of a shipwright, a ferocious fighter, and the guardian of a very deadly secret! Franky decided to join the Straw Hats to fulfill
            his dream of creating and riding a ship capable of circumnavigating the world, the Thousand Sunny.<br><br>
